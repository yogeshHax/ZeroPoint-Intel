Here is a **Professional, Hackathon-Winning `README.md**` for your GitHub repository.

I have updated the **Tech Stack** and **Setup Instructions** to match the actual **React (Vite) + Python (Flask)** code we wrote together, so it is accurate for the judges.

## 📌 Project Overview

**ZeroPoint Intel** (codenamed *Polaris*) is an autonomous, asset-aware threat intelligence aggregator designed to bridge the critical "Time Gap" between a vulnerability discovery and a security patch.

In a world where hackers automate attacks, manual defense is obsolete. Our platform autonomously scrapes high-fidelity sources (NVD, GitHub, Dark Web feeds), normalizes the data using NLP, and visualizes the global "blast radius" of threats in real-time.

Crucially, it is **Asset-Aware**: instead of flooding you with generic alerts, it correlates threats against your specific tech stack (e.g., Docker, Windows, Apache), generating a dynamic **Risk Score** so you focus only on what matters.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🌐 3D Threat Visualization:** Interactive holographic globe showing active threat vectors in real-time.
* **🧠 Autonomous Scraper:** Python-based "Hunter" engine that aggregates CVEs from NVD and simulated dark web sources.
* **⚡ Asset-Aware Risk Scoring:**
    * *Algorithm:* `Risk = (CVSS Score * 0.6) + (Asset Criticality * 0.4)`
    * Prioritizes alerts based on **your** infrastructure.
* **🕵️ Zero-Day Detection:** Identifies vulnerabilities before they appear in official government databases.
* **📜 Live Terminal Feed:** "Matrix-style" logs showing real-time scanning, packet analysis, and uplink status.
* **🔦 Dark Mode UI:** Military-grade "Glassmorphism" aesthetic built for high-performance Security Operations Centers (SOC).
